# learn_python

This repository contains small Python projects used for learning. The `horizontal-runner` folder holds a simple Pygame example `runner.py` that draws a square you can move with the arrow keys.

Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the example:

```bash
cd horizontal-runner
python runner.py
```

Notes

- The project ignores `.venv/` via the top-level `.gitignore`. Do not commit your virtual environments.
- Use small, frequent commits while experimenting.
